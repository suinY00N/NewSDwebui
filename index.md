This research proposes a systematic approach to improve the user interface (UI) of the Stable Diffusion Web UI, focusing on intuitive design and enhanced accessibility. Despite its powerful capabilities, the complexity of Stable Diffusion's UI can hinder user experience. The study integrates UX design principles with those developed specifically for generative AI to analyze problems and design improvements. The research process involved literature review, analysis of related services, identification of problems through user interviews, and design and development of solutions based on User-Centered Design principles. The effectiveness of the improved UI was validated through usability tests using Maze and surveys, which confirmed enhancements in cognitive load reduction, work efficiency, transparency, and system trust. This research addresses the gap in validating UI improvements post-design by implementing and verifying them, offering valuable insights for future AI system designs.

## Background
The surge in AI-powered image generation tools has significantly impacted digital art and content creation. However, the complexity of these systems, especially in open-source models like Stable Diffusion, often makes them inaccessible to beginners and non-technical users, leading to a poor user experience.

## Objective
This paper aims to redesign the UI of Stable Diffusion Web UI to be more intuitive and efficient, making the powerful features of the system accessible and usable for all user levels, from beginners to experienced professionals.


## Key Ideas
Direct Coding Implementation: The research includes the hands-on development of UI improvements. Modifications were made directly in the codebase, integrating user-centered design principles to enhance the interface's intuitiveness and functionality. The coding process involved refining information architecture, simplifying the workflow, and enhancing interaction feedback mechanisms.

User-Centered Design (UCD): The improvements were grounded in UCD principles, focusing on reducing user cognitive load, optimizing task workflows, and providing clear and actionable feedback within the UI. This approach ensured that the UI caters effectively to both novice and experienced users.

Systematic Usability Testing: After implementing the UI improvements, the study conducted rigorous usability testing using the Maze tool to validate the effectiveness of the changes. The testing involved real users performing predefined tasks while their interactions were monitored and analyzed. This provided quantitative data on task completion times, error rates, and qualitative feedback on user satisfaction and interface intuitiveness.

Evaluation and Feedback: The usability tests were complemented with user surveys to gather comprehensive feedback. This dual approach helped in assessing the real-world application of the UI enhancements and provided insights into further refinement.

Transparency and Trust: By improving the UI's information structure and interactive feedback, the study aimed to enhance the system's transparency and users' trust, critical factors in technology adoption and user satisfaction.

Description: This figure illustrates the average completion time in seconds for various tasks performed using the Stable Diffusion Web UI, segmented by users with and without prior experience. Each task is identified by a task number (1-1, 1-2, etc.), with the tasks on the x-axis and the average time on the y-axis. The error bars indicate standard deviations, showing variability in task completion time. The chart demonstrates that experienced users generally complete tasks faster than those with no experience, especially in tasks that require deeper interaction with the UI, such as 1-6 and 2-2, indicating a learning curve associated with the systemâ€™s complexity.




## Significance
This research contributes to the field by offering a structured approach to UI/UX design in AI systems, ensuring that the functionality of such powerful tools can be fully leveraged by users without extensive technical knowledge.
